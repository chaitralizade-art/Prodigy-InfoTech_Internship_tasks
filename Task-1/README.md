# 🏦 Task 1 - Bank Fraud Detection

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent bank transactions using Machine Learning techniques. 
The objective is to build a predictive model that can classify whether a transaction is fraudulent or legitimate based on transaction-related features.

## 🎯 Objective
- Analyze banking transaction data
- Identify suspicious patterns
- Handle imbalanced datasets
- Train and evaluate classification models
- Improve fraud detection performance

## 📊 Dataset Description
The dataset contains transaction-related information such as:
- Transaction amount
- Account details
- Transaction type
- Location information
- Time of transaction
- Fraud label (0 = Legitimate, 1 = Fraud)

The dataset is highly imbalanced, as fraudulent transactions are significantly fewer than legitimate ones.

## 🔍 Steps Performed
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Handling Missing Values
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data Visualization
- Feature Engineering
- Train-Test Split
- Model Training
- Model Evaluation

## 🤖 Machine Learning Algorithms Used
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier
- Decision Tree Classifier
- (Add any other algorithm you used)

## 📈 Model Evaluation Metrics
Due to class imbalance, the following metrics were used:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-Score
- Confusion Matrix

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🚀 Outcome
Successfully developed a machine learning model capable of detecting fraudulent transactions, helping reduce financial risks and improving banking security systems.
